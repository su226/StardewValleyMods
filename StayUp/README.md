# StayUp [![Download at Nexus Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/download_from-nexus_mods-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7592)
StayUp mod let you work 24 hours per day without collapsing at 2:00 am.
I'm using Omegasis' [Night Owl](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/433) mod before, but it doesn't support 1.5 and multiplayer, so I made this mod. 

## Features
- Support Stardew Valley 1.5.
- Save and jump into a new day at 6:00 am.
- Keep your and your horse's position automatically.
- Keep stamina and health. (Disabled by default)
- Tested in multiplayer. (But not split screen)
- Supress time shake and tired emote.
- Morning light transition works with any weather.
- Smart fish editing for your fishing needs.
- Fully ï»¿configurable.
